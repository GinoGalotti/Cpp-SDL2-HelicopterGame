Cpp-SDL2-HelicopterGame
=======================

The first game that I've made: a 'helicopter' type of game using SDL2 and C++. I've used Code::blocks IDE, so I'll upload the project's folder

Done by: Surth (Luis Galotti Mu√±oz), I've used a customized version of the class LTexture from Lazy Foo's tutorial.

All the images belong to me (Luis Galotti), but I've downloaded the Font.
